      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2016, White Water Rafting Co. began as a small, passionate group of river guides who wanted to share their love for the outdoors and adrenaline-filled experiences. What started with a single raft and a dream has grown into one of the regionâ€™s most trusted adventure tour providers. Over the years, we've guided thousands of thrill-seekers through some of the most scenic and challenging white water rapids in the country, always with safety, excitement, and unforgettable memories as our top priorities.</p>
